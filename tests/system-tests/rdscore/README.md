# RDS Core System Tests

Documentaion of parameters to be set for running this test suite.

### _VerifySRIOVWorkloadsOnSameNodeDifferentNet_

This test verifies connectivity between pods that use different SR-IOV networks and are scheduled
on the same node.

Test expects `nc` process to listen on IP address(es) on SR-IOV interfaces on both workloads,
for e.g. on `192.168.12.22 1111` on 1st workload and `192.168.12.33 1111` on 2nd workload.

Messages are sent between the workloads and asserted they are present in pods' logs.

**Requires 2 SR-IOV networks that have SR-IOV resources configured on the same node**
